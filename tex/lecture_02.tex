    \subsection{Relations}
    Let $X$ be any set.
    A \emph{relation} $R$ on $X$ is a particular subset $R \subset X \times X$ that is
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{reflexive} if $\forall x \in X$ $(x, x) \in R$;
        \item \emph{symmetric} if $\forall x, y \in X$ $(x, y) \in R \iff (y, x) \in R$;
        \item \emph{transitive} if $\forall x, y, z \in X$ $\left[ (x, y) \in R \text{ and } (y, z) \in R \right] \implies (x, z) \in R$.
    \end{itemize}
    The statement $(x, y) \in R$ is read ``$x$ is \emph{related} to $y$.''
    Alternatively, we write this as $x R y$ or $x \sim y$.

    $R$ is called an \emph{equivalence relation} if it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
    For any equivalence relation $R$ on a set $X$, we define the \emph{equivalence class} of $x \in X$ to be the set of all elements of $X$ that are related to $x$,
    \[
        \eqclass{x} = \set[y \in X]{x \sim y}
    ,\]
    where $\eqclass{\cdot}: X \rightarrow 2^X$ is a mapping from $x$ to its equivalence class.
    The set of all equivalence classes under the relation is the image of $X$ under $\eqclass{\cdot}$,
    \[
        \faktor{X}{\sim} = \eqclass{X} \subset 2^X  
    .\]

    \begin{remark}
        Let $X$ be any set with $\sim$ an equivalence relation on $X$.
        Then
        \[
            X = \bigsqcup_{Y \in \nicefrac{X}{\sim}} Y  
        ,\]
        i.e.\ the equivalence relation $\sim$ partitions $X$ into a disjoint collection of equivalence classes.
        \tcblower
        \begin{proof}
            Let $Y, Z \subset X$ be equivalence classes.
            Note that equivalence classes are nonempty since equivalence relations are reflexive, so it suffices to prove that if $Y \cap Z \neq \emptyset$, then $Y = Z$.

            Let $x_0 \in Y \cap Z$, $x_1 \in Y$, and $x_2 \in Z$.
            Then $x_0 \sim x_1$ and $x_0 \sim x_2$, so by symmetry and transitivity we have $x_1 \sim x_2$.
            This implies that 
            \[
                Y = \eqclass{x_1} = \eqclass{x_2} = Z
            \]
            as desired.
        \end{proof}
    \end{remark}

    Although we have not yet formally introduced $\Z$, consider the following example from abstract algebra:

    \begin{example}
        Fix $n \in \N$.
        We say for any $a, b \in \Z$ that $a \sim b$ if $n \mid a - b$.
        Then $a$ is \emph{congruent} to $b$ modulo $n$, or $a \equiv b \Mod{n}$.
        Congruence modulo $n$ is an equivalence relation on $\Z$, and the ring $\Z_n$ (also denoted $\Z/n\Z$) is the set of equivalence classes under this relation:
        \begin{align*}
            \Z_2 &= \set{\eqclass{0}, \eqclass{1}} \\
            \Z_3 &= \set{\eqclass{0}, \eqclass{1}, \eqclass{{2}}} \\
            &\vdotswithin{=} \\
            \Z_n &= \set{\eqclass{0}, \eqclass{1}, \eqclass{2}, \dots, \eqclass{n - 1}} \\
            &\vdotswithin{=}
        \end{align*}
    \end{example}


    \subsection{Grothendieck groups}
    Recall that a \emph{semigroup} is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an associative binary operation.
    Our definition of $\N$ equipped with $+$ constitutes a semigroup, so we now introduce commutative semigroups with cancellation.
    \begin{definition}[title=Commutative semigroup with cancellation, label=commutative-cancellative-semigroup]
        $(S, +)$ is a \emph{commutative semigroup} if, for all $a, b, c \in S$, we have
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$,
            \item $a + b = b + a$.
        \end{itemize}
        $(S, +)$ has the \emph{cancellation property} if, for all $a, b, c \in S$,
        \[
            a + c = b + c \implies a = b
        .\]
    \end{definition}

    \begin{lemma}[label=n-additive-cancellation]
        $(\N, +)$ has the cancellation property.
        \tcblower
        \begin{proof}
            Let $A(m)$ be the statement
            \[
                \forall k, l \in \N \quad k + m = l + m \implies k = l
            ,\]
            and we will prove by induction that $A(m)$ holds for all $m \in \N$.
            When $m = 1$ we have
            \[
                k + 1 = l + 1 \iff S(k) = S(l)  
            ,\]
            which implies $k = l$ since $S$ is injective.

            Now assume $A(m)$ is true for some $m \geq 1$.
            Let $k, l \in \N$ satisfy
            \[
                k + (m + 1) = l + (m + 1)
            .\]
            Then by associativity and the induction hypothesis,
            \begin{align*}
                (k + m) + 1 = (l + m) + 1 &\xRightarrow{A(1)} k + m = l + m \\
                &\xRightarrow{A(m)} k = l.
            \end{align*}
        \end{proof}
    \end{lemma}

    Recall that an \emph{abelian group} is a group whose operation is commutative:
    \begin{definition}[title=Abelian group, label=abelian-group]
        $(G, \circ, 1)$ is an \emph{abelian group} if it satisfies:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \eqmakebox[abelianAxioms][l]{$1 \circ g = g \circ 1 = g$} \emph{identity}
            \item \eqmakebox[abelianAxioms][l]{$(g \circ h) \circ k = g \circ (h \circ k)$} \emph{associativity}
            \item \eqmakebox[abelianAxioms][l]{$\forall g \: \exists! \, h$ such that $g \circ h = h \circ g = 1$ \qquad\qquad} \emph{invertibility}
            \item \eqmakebox[abelianAxioms][l]{$g \circ h = h \circ g$} \emph{commutativity}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{definition}
    As we will now see, abelian groups are central to our construction of $\R$ through the construction of \emph{Grothendieck groups}.\footnote{
        Construction of such groups first introduced by Alexander Grothendieck, 1928--2014.
    }

    \begin{lemma}[title=Grothendieck lemma, label=grothendieck-lemma]
        Let $(S, +)$ be a nonempty commutative semigroup with cancellation.
        Then there exists a smallest abelian group containing $S$ called the \emph{Grothendieck group} for $S$.
        \tcblower
        \begin{proof}
            We first construct an abelian group $G$ from $S$.
            For any $a, b, c, d \in S$, define the relation $(a, b) \sim (c, d)$ if and only if $a + d = b + c$.\footnote{
                This idea comes from fractions: $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \iff ad = bc$, but our operation is additive rather than multiplicative.
            }
            Indeed, this is an equivalence relation on $S$.
            For transitivity, assume $(a, b) \sim (c, d) \sim (e, f)$.
            Then
            \begin{align*}
                \left.\begin{aligned}
                    a + d &= b + c \\
                    c + f &= d + e
                \end{aligned}\right\}
                &\implies a + d + c + f = b + c + d + e \\
                &\implies a + f = b + e \\
                &\implies (a, b) \sim (e, f).
            \end{align*}
            Try proving reflexivity and symmetry for practice.

            Now let $G := \nicefrac{(S \times S)}{\sim}$ be equipped with the binary operation $+$ defined by
            \[
                \eqclass{(a, b)} + \eqclass{(c, d)} := \eqclass{(a + c), (b + d)}
            .\]
            This operation is well-defined and clearly associative and commutative; proofs of these claims are also left to the reader.

            To confirm that $G$ is a group, it remains to show that $G$ has an identity element and unique inverses.
            For the former, fix any $a \in S$.
            Note that for all $a, b, c \in S$, $(a, a) \sim (b, b)$ since $a + b = a + b$; and
            \[
                \eqclass{(a, a)} + \eqclass{(b, c)} = \eqclass{(a + b, a + c)} = \eqclass{(b, c)}  
            \]
            because $a + b + c = a + c + b$.
            Thus, $\eqclass{(a, a)} = 0$ is an identity for $G$.

            For inverses, consider any $\eqclass{(a, b)} \in G$.
            Take $\eqclass{(b, a)}$ so that
            \[
                \eqclass{(a, b)} + \eqclass{(b, a)} = \eqclass{(a + b, a + b)} = 0
            ,\]
            hence $\eqclass{(a, b)}$ is invertible.
            Proof of uniqueness is left to the reader.

            So far, we have shown that $G$ is indeed an abelian group.
            Proof that $G$ contains $S$ and is the \emph{smallest} such abelian group is covered in the exercises.
        \end{proof}
    \end{lemma}

    Naturally, our interest in the Grothendieck lemma is in constructing the integers and the rational numbers from the natural numbers.
